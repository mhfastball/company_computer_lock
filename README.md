# company_computer_lock

During lockdowns, wrote this script to bypass company imposed "Computer Lock/Sleep" since we're no longer in the office and dont have to worry about co-workers messing with computers.

Basically functions as a "Ghost-Key" where the script simulates keypresses until a specified time and then (supposedly) exits and shuts off.
